# Colors

Colors is a simple terminal program that
will ask you for the result of the combination
of two base colors.

If you `assert` the answer, it will ask you if
you want to play again.

If you fail, or if you say not `y` when it asks
you to try again, it will throw an error.

## How to use it

Just run:

    node colors.js
